Description:	Weight configuration interface for nodeN

		The interleave weight for a memory node (N). These weights are
		utilized by tasks which have set their mempolicy to
		MPOL_WEIGHTED_INTERLEAVE.

		These weights only affect new allocations, and changes at runtime
		will not cause migrations on already allocated pages.

		The minimum weight for a node is always 1.

		Minimum weight: 1
		Maximum weight: 255

		Writing invalid values (i.e. any values not in [1,255],
		empty string, ...) will return -EINVAL.

		Changing the weight to a valid value will automatically
		update the system to manual mode as well.

Description:	Auto-weighting configuration interface

		Configuration mode for weighted interleave. A 'Y' indicates
		that the system is in auto mode, and a 'N' indicates that
		the system is in manual mode. All other values are invalid.

		In auto mode, all node weights are re-calculated and overwritten
		(visible via the nodeN interfaces) whenever new bandwidth data
		is made available during either boot or hotplug events.

		In manual mode, node weights can only be updated by the user.
		Note that nodes that are onlined with previously set / defaulted
		weights will inherit those weights. If they were not previously
		set or are onlined with missing bandwidth data, they will be
		defaulted to a weight of 1.

		Writing Y or 1 to the interface will enable auto mode, while
		writing N or 0 will enable manual mode. All other strings will
		be ignored, and -EINVAL will be returned.

		If Y or 1 is written to the interface but the recalculation or
		updates fail at any point (-ENOMEM or -ENODEV), then the system
		will remain in manual mode.

		Writing a new weight to a node directly via the nodeN interface
		will also automatically update the system to manual mode.
